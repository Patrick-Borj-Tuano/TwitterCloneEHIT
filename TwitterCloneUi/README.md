# How your website accomplished each item in the criteria.
## 1. Where could the concepts discussed in class be seen in your website?
>As a group, we somewhat made use of all of the topics discussed in Module 1. We made use of some of the basic HTML elements (especially divs) in creating the basic and original format/layout of the website and also the way in which the user can submit a post. A lot of CSS was also used to further improved the layout and overall design of the website. We also utilized Flexbox to make our website more flexible not only in terms of design but also in terms of media responsiveness. Certain transitions were also used to further enhance responsiveness. Finally, JavaScript was essential in implementing most of the functionalities in the website, mainly the integration of the API, event listeners, and dynamic content updates.


## 2. What was your inspiration for the design of the website?
> The main inspiration for our website was Twitter. We tried to somewhat mimic Twitter's layout and functionalities but we prioritized in making the design very simple. Our group also decided to make the website have more of a dark themed look.

## 3. What was your approach in creating the content of the website?
> Our main approach as a group was to focus mainly on ensuring the intended functionalities we want to work first before focusing on the design. At the start, we simply just added very simple layout/design and then we all focused on implementing different features we want the website to have. We made sure to double check every functionality that we wanted to implement into our website was working as intended as we believe that is the most important aspect for this project. After finishing and implementing the coding for all of the functionalities, we then decided to finish up the complete design of the website.

## 4. How is your website creative?
> As a group, we feel that our way of designing and implementing the features that we envisioned is what makes our website creative in a way. Our website's creative use of colors and layouting, prioritizing simplicity, ensures that users will have an easy time navigating through our website and not get overwhelmed with information.

# How you worked as a team to accomplish the project
### 6. How did you divide the tasks between the team, and what is the responsibility of each one?
>At the start, we first held a meeting to decide the rough sketch of what the website would look like. After that, we then decided to focus on the important functionalities and features that our website would need. Each one of us decided for our own what feature/functionality to focus on. Paolo was responsible for integrating most of the API into our website, ensuring that the back-end functionalities that were provided by our professor were utilized effectively into our website. Both Patrick and Joshua focused on the overall styling and design of the website and the way how the users would register and login to the website. They were also responsible for making sure that the divs and containers that will be used in the website are well organized and clean to look at, dictating the website's overall look and design. Finally, Juan was mostly focused on implementing how the posting mechanics/logic would work and how the posts would look like when the user submits their posts to the website. 

## 7. How did you prevent your changes in code from conflicting with each other?
> We made sure to always remind everyone when we are pushing our codes to GitHub. Furthermore, we regularly held meetings to discuss the things that we had to work on and made sure that everyone was able to discuss their thoughts when making the website and everyone is on the same page.

## 8. How you could improve your website in the future
> As a group, we feel that there are a lot of ways that we could improve on our website.
